=====
Setup
=====

1. Download the installer for your operating system from https://github.com/rsjaffe/MIDI2LR/releases, where you will always find the latest version. When selecting a folder for installation, make sure you don't need administrator privileges to write to that folder—the plugin may crash if it is running in a restricted folder.

2. In Lightroom, add the MIDI2LR plugin by going to File→Plugin-Manager→Add and navigating to and selecting the MIDI2LR.lrplugin folder.

3. The MIDI2LR application should automatically launch. If it is closed, it can be launched by going to File→Plug-in Extras→Start MIDI2LR

4. Moving any controllers will populate the mapping table and allow you to set functions. You can also save/load mappings.

5. Information on all the settings and options are in the wiki: https://github.com/rsjaffe/MIDI2LR/wiki.
